                <p class="text-indent-1 "><span class="level-num editorial" id="paras/1">¶1</span> This is a direct appeal of the Trial Judge's dismissal of Appellant's lawsuit over an employee wage dispute with the Community. The order at issue was issued by the Tribal Court on August 17<sup>th</sup>, 2018. Appellants filed their brief with this Honorable Court on November 5<sup>th</sup>, 2018 and the Community filed an Appellee's brief on December 4<sup>th</sup>, 2018. The matter was argued before the three member Stockbridge-Munsee Court of Appeals on February 8<sup>th</sup>, 2018.</p>
                <h2 class="text-indent-1 " id="facts-on-appeal">II. FACTS ON APPEAL</h2>
                <p class="text-indent-1 "><span class="level-num editorial" id="paras/2">¶2</span> In their February 6<sup>th</sup>, 2017 petition in the Tribal Court, Appellants alleged that they received notice from the Community that their wages would be frozen pursuant to a new wage scale adopted by the Community. As a result, Appellant Hoffman's employment wages from the Community were frozen until 2022 and Appellant Miller's employment wages were frozen until 2024.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1 "><span class="level-num editorial" id="paras/3">¶3</span> Appellants requested remedies available under <a class="internal-link " href="/us/nsn/mohican/council/code/EMP.03.15" title="Section EMP.03.15 — Enforcement">§55.15 of the Stockbridge-Munsee Tribal Fair Labor Standards Ordinance</a> including back-pay, actual damages, punitive damages and legal fees.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1 "><span class="level-num editorial" id="paras/4">¶4</span> On March 6, 2018, the Community reconsidered the wage freeze and by motion unfroze the employee wages. Subsequent to the Community's action, the Tribal HR department paid the amount of back wages owed the Appellees. The HR determination was that Appellants would receive back-pay based on the difference between what Appellants would have received without the wage freeze and what they actually were paid. Appellant Hoffman received back- pay in the amount of $2963.45 and Appellant Miller received back-pay in the amount of $1439.90.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1 "><span class="level-num editorial" id="paras/5">¶5</span> Pursuant to the award of back-pay to each of the Appellants, the Tribal Community filed a Motion to Dismiss in this case arguing that since the back-pay rewards had been awarded, there no longer was a case or controversy. Subsequent to the Motion to Dismiss the Tribal Judge recused herself from the case.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1 "><span class="level-num editorial" id="paras/6">¶6</span> On August 20<sup>th</sup>, 2018 <em>Pro Tem</em> Judge Layatlati Hill issued a decision on the Motion to Dismiss. In granting the Motion to Dismiss, the Court ruled that the only available relief, back-pay, was granted and no further case or controversy existed.</p>
